# 🏆 Marisa OJ - Algorithms & Olympiad Legacy

> "Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out."

This folder contains my solutions to problems on [Marisa OJ](https://marisaoj.com), a platform that played a **super duper huge part** in my coding career. 

### 🌟 Why Marisa OJ?
In my experience, this is probably the best platform for:
* **Problem Selection:** It chooses the most high-quality problems for each specific algorithm.
* **National Olympiad Prep:** It covers all the essential algorithms needed if you want to pursue the **National Informatics Olympiad**.

### 📂 Repository Structure
Most of the source files here are named after their corresponding **Problem ID** on the website for easy look-up.

* **Format:** `[Problem_ID].cpp`
* **Direct Access:** You can find the problem by visiting `https://marisaoj.com/problem/[ID]`
